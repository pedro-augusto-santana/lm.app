given the file api-source.txt, you are instructed to:

1. restyle the application using login-screen.tsx as the base for look and feel
2. in the assignment-details-screen, you should preview the lessons, and add a simple "Começar!" button
3. you should reroute the application to the needs
4. the assignment-details-screen should navigate to the lessons-screen, which is a paged screen, that should have
one page for each lesson. for lesson_type = "complete": word -> is the target, similar to hanged man game, one letter per box, and for the indexes in hint, they should be readonly and visible.
and for "quizz" -> there should be N cards, N being the number of options, and one correct answer.
5. the lessons-screen needs to be paginated, and when finished, there should be an api call to "example.org/json/" (use this exact url) and send
in the answer.

execute the tasks provided, there is no reason to run the application and test, that will be left to me
do not change the instructions.txt or api-source.txt files
